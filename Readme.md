# scoreboard

  scoreboard is a light weight leaderboard for node.js.  It can be used keep score and ranks between multiple objects and scoring types. It is backed by Redis and sorted sets.

## Where to use
* Trending Charts
* Realtime Charts
* Historical Charts
* Game mechanics

## Installation

      $ npm install scoreboard

## Example

### Setup
```js    
var scoreboard = require('scoreboard')
var Score = scoreboard.Score;
var scores = new Score();
````

### Redis Connection Settings
```javascript
scoreboard.redis.createClient = function() {
  var client = redis.createClient(1234, '192.168.100.1');
  client.auth('somethingsecret');
  return client;
};
```

### Indexing
 Awarding point to an object is simple. Scoreboard supports multiple leaderboards, and is are partitioned by different a `key`

```js
scores.index('monsters', 100, 'edward');
scores.index('aliens', 100, 'edward');
scores.index('monsters', 50, 'nancy');
scores.index('aliens', 200, 'nancy');
```

### Leaderboard
 To perform a query against the scoreboard to find the leaders, you simple use `Score#leader` with a list of keys, and invoke `run` with a callback to fetch the results

#### Single scoreboard

 Find leader in just `monsters`

```js
scores.leader({keys:['monsters']}).run(function(err, leaderboard) {
  console.log(leaderboard);
});
```

 Results

```js
['edward', 'nancy']
```

#### Multiple scoreboards

 Find leader in both `monsters` and `aliens`.  The scores across the two sets are totalled together

```js
scores.leader({keys:['monsters','aliens']}).run(function(err, leaderboard) {
  console.log(leaderboard);
});
```

 Results:

```js
['nancy', 'edward']
```

#### Time series plus multiple scoreboards

 Score are stored in Redis on two types of buckets, `overall` and `days`.  Obviously the `overall` buckets are used to track scores thoughout the entire life of the scoreboard.  But `day` buckets allow for more percise queries. 
 
This will return the leaderboard for `monsters` and `aliens` between `1/1/2012` and `1/31/2012`:

```js
scores.leader({ keys:['monsters','aliens'], date: {$start: new Date('1/1/2012'), $end: new Date('1/31/2012') } }).run(function(err, leaderboard) {
    console.log(leaderboard);
});
``` 

 Results:

```js
['nancy', 'edward']
```

#### Pagination

 Paginations is super easy with scoreboard.  All you need is `skip` and `limit`

 This will return the top 0 - 100 of the time series leaderboard

```js
scores.leader({ keys:['monsters','aliens'], date: {$start: new Date('1/1/2012'), $end: new Date('1/31/2012') } })
  .skip(0)
  .limit(100)
  .run(function(err, leaderboard) {
    console.log(leaderboard);
  });
```
